# Information Retrieval and Text Mining course (DAT640), University of Stavanger, fall 2020

## Course format

**DISCLAIMER: Everything is subject to change.**

The course follows a hybrid format, where lecture videos are provided online and classroom time is used for discussion, [exercises](exercises/), and working on [assignments](assignments/).

Due to physical space limitations (re: COVID social distancing measures), students are divided to groups A and B. Each class and lab will be given in two identical editions, for group A (Mon and Tue 14:15-15:00, Wed 08:15-09:00) and for group B (Mon and Tue 15:15-16:00, Wed 09:15-10:00). Group assignments can be found on Canvas. Attendance will be logged.

The semester is divided into lecture and group project work periods, with an (optional) trial exam in between.

### Lecture period (weeks 35-42)

  * Mondays and Tuesdays are classes for discussion and exercises, led by Krisztian Balog (KB).
    - The respective video lectures are made available at least 24hours before the class. You need to watch the video before the class, otherwise you will not be able to meaningfully participate in the discussion and undertake the exercises.
  * Wednesdays are labs for getting help on the obligatory [assignments](assignments/), led by Trond Linjordet (TL).
    - Assignments are to be solved individually. They constitute 50% the project work.

### Trial exam (week 43)

A trial exam will be made available mirroring the same setup that will be used at the final exam. The exam will not be corrected, but the answer key will be shared.

### Group project work (weeks 44-46)

Students will need to complete a project in groups of 2-3, and write a report that will be graded.

There will be a pool of options to select a project from. During the project period, each group can request a 15mins dedicated weekly discussion slot with the lecturer during the class hours (Mon/Tue), and can get feedback on the draft report from the teaching assistant during lab hours (Wed). Both in-person and remote (Zoom) options will be available.
