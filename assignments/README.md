# Assignments

Three main assignments, with the first two divided into sub-assignments (A and B parts).

| Assignment | Announced | Deadline | Points |
| -- | :--: | :--: | --: |
| Assignment 1 (three parts) ||| 10 |

## Workflow and rules

  * Each assignment is given as a Jupyter notebook and is pushed to your private GitHub repository.
  * You need to submit and push the solution to GitHub.
  * Deadlines are strict, no extensions, no exceptions!
  * We have a zero tolerance policy for cheating. Copying someone else's solution, even in part, will be considered plagiarism and may result in failing the whole course.
  * Assignments account for **40% of the final grade**.
